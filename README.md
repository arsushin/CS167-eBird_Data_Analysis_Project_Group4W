# CS167-eBird_Data_Analysis_Project_Group4W
In this project, we will perform some analytical tasks on a dataset that represents bird observations. We will combine this dataset with a ZIP code dataset to determine the ZIP code for each point. Then, we will perform two analytical tasks, one based on ZIP codes, and one based on time. The results will be visualized using existing tools.
